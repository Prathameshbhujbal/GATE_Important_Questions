*** Question ***


***

Instruction execution in a processor is divided into 5 stages. Instruction Fetch (IF). Instruction Decode (ID). Operand Fetch (OF). Execute (EX), and Write Back (WB). These stages take 5, 4, 20, 10, and 3 nanoseconds (ns) respectively. A pipelined implementation of the processor requires buffering between each pair of consecutive stages with a delay of 2 ns. Two pipelined implementations of the processor are contemplated:
(i) a naive pipeline implementation (NP) with 5 stages and
(ii) an efficient pipeline (EP) where the OF stage is divided into stages OF1 and OF2 with
execution times of 12 ns and 8 ns respectively.
The speedup (correct to two decimal places) achieved by EP over NP in executing 20 independent instructions with no hazards is_______.

***

*** Solution ***

To determine the speedup achieved by EP over NP, we calculate the execution time for both pipelines and then compute the ratio.

### Naive Pipeline (NP)
1. **Stage Times:**  
   - IF = 5 ns, ID = 4 ns, OF = 20 ns, EX = 10 ns, WB = 3 ns.
2. **Cycle Time:**  
   The cycle time for the naive pipeline is determined by the slowest stage plus the buffer delay:
   \[
   \text{Cycle Time (NP)} = \text{max}(\text{IF, ID, OF, EX, WB}) + \text{Buffer Delay} = 20 \, \text{ns} + 2 \, \text{ns} = 22 \, \text{ns}.
   \]
3. **Total Execution Time for 20 Instructions:**  
   The time to execute \( k \) instructions in a pipeline is:
   \[
   T = \text{Latency} + (\text{Cycle Time} \times (k - 1)).
   \]
   Latency for NP = \( \text{Number of Stages} \times \text{Cycle Time} = 5 \times 22 = 110 \, \text{ns} \).

   For \( k = 20 \):
   \[
   T_\text{NP} = 110 + 22 \times (20 - 1) = 110 + 418 = 528 \, \text{ns}.
   \]

### Efficient Pipeline (EP)
1. **Stage Times:**  
   The OF stage is divided into:
   - OF1 = 12 ns, OF2 = 8 ns.
   - The new stages are: IF (5 ns), ID (4 ns), OF1 (12 ns), OF2 (8 ns), EX (10 ns), WB (3 ns).
2. **Cycle Time:**  
   The cycle time is determined by the slowest stage plus the buffer delay:
   \[
   \text{Cycle Time (EP)} = \text{max}(\text{IF, ID, OF1, OF2, EX, WB}) + \text{Buffer Delay}.
   \]
   The slowest stage is OF1 = 12 ns:
   \[
   \text{Cycle Time (EP)} = 12 \, \text{ns} + 2 \, \text{ns} = 14 \, \text{ns}.
   \]
3. **Total Execution Time for 20 Instructions:**  
   Latency for EP = \( \text{Number of Stages} \times \text{Cycle Time} = 6 \times 14 = 84 \, \text{ns} \).

   For \( k = 20 \):
   \[
   T_\text{EP} = 84 + 14 \times (20 - 1) = 84 + 266 = 350 \, \text{ns}.
   \]

---

### Speedup Calculation
The speedup is the ratio of the execution times for NP and EP:
\[
\text{Speedup} = \frac{T_\text{NP}}{T_\text{EP}} = \frac{528}{350} \approx 1.51.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The speedup achieved by EP over NP is **1.51**.
