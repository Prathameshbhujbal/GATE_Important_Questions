To determine the speedup achieved by EP over NP, we calculate the execution time for both pipelines and then compute the ratio.

### Naive Pipeline (NP)
1. **Stage Times:**  
   - IF = 5 ns, ID = 4 ns, OF = 20 ns, EX = 10 ns, WB = 3 ns.

2. **Cycle Time:**  
   The cycle time for the naive pipeline is determined by the slowest stage plus the buffer delay:
   - Cycle Time (NP) = max(IF, ID, OF, EX, WB) + Buffer Delay  
     = 20 ns + 2 ns = **22 ns**.

3. **Total Execution Time for 20 Instructions:**  
   The time to execute `k` instructions in a pipeline is:  
   **T = Latency + (Cycle Time × (k - 1))**  

   Latency for NP:  
   - Number of Stages × Cycle Time = 5 × 22 = **110 ns**  

   For `k = 20`:  
   - T_NP = 110 + 22 × (20 - 1)  
   - T_NP = 110 + 418 = **528 ns**

### Efficient Pipeline (EP)
1. **Stage Times:**  
   The OF stage is divided into two parts:  
   - OF1 = 12 ns, OF2 = 8 ns.  
   The new stages are: IF (5 ns), ID (4 ns), OF1 (12 ns), OF2 (8 ns), EX (10 ns), WB (3 ns).

2. **Cycle Time:**  
   The cycle time is determined by the slowest stage plus the buffer delay:  
   - Cycle Time (EP) = max(IF, ID, OF1, OF2, EX, WB) + Buffer Delay  
     = 12 ns + 2 ns = **14 ns**.

3. **Total Execution Time for 20 Instructions:**  
   Latency for EP:  
   - Number of Stages × Cycle Time = 6 × 14 = **84 ns**  

   For `k = 20`:  
   - T_EP = 84 + 14 × (20 - 1)  
   - T_EP = 84 + 266 = **350 ns**

### Speedup Calculation
The speedup is the ratio of the execution times for NP and EP:  
**Speedup = T_NP / T_EP**  
**Speedup = 528 / 350 ≈ 1.51**

---

### Final Answer:
The speedup achieved by EP over NP is **1.51**.
